## Membership Requirements

Membership to the GitHub organizations is a significant milestone for contributors who
have shown persistent commitment and dedication to Meshery projects. It is not solely about
writing code but rather the consistency of engagement and alignment of mentality.

Contributors who may be invited typically:

- Have been actively involved in the community for several weeks
- Make regular updates to projects
- Help other community members
- Attend development meetings
- Demonstrate a willingness to learn and share knowledge
- Show a genuine desire to improve themselves, others, and the projects

## Invitation Process

Depending on the number and quality of contributions made across the five GitHub organizations of Meshery, contributors can receive an invitation to any or all of these orgs. The process involves:

1. Sending a group DM
2. Executing Slack slash command in `#community-management`

## Group Message for Invitations

When you identify a worthy contributor, send a message in a group DM that includes the individual and other maintainers/appropriate members.

> Refer to the **Community Managers' docs** to see some examples.

## Sending the GitHub Invitation

To send the invitation to join the GitHub organization, use the following slash command in the `#community-management` channel:

`/invite-github [email address] [organization name]`

Where [organization name] should be:

- meshery â€“ to invite the email address to Meshery GitHub organization under the "contributors" team

For example:

`/invite-github contributor@example.com meshery`
